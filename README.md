 ## This is just a simple prototype which increces my problem solving skills and helps me to undersatnd how the DOM works in JavaScript

 this project / assignment is not fully complited and functional. For frontend I use html, css, JavaScript. I used a framework of css called tailwind and used a ui called daisyui.
 every part of this project is simple coding problem you can understand this by seeing this flowing: <br> <br>

 1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
    
   => the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll: <br> <br>

  | getElementById | getElementsByClassName | querySelector / querySelectorAll |
  |----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
  | it takes the id (should be unique) form your html.    | it takes the all elements with a spesific class name.   | it selects all the same thing in html.   |
  | this is fast and direct method    | it returns a html collection   | this is flexiable and mordern and it returns a node list   |

 2. How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM? 
    
    => document.createElement('Element name')

 3.What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?  
 
   => event bubbling means that when an event happen first it goes to the last child and then came back to the praents.

  4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
      
   => Event delegation means add a event listener to the parent element. which triggers by its child element. it's useful because it improves dynamic content, clean code and it's faster also easy to handle.

 6. What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?
    
    => preventDeafault() => this method is basically used in form because it stops the form tofrom submitting
    => stopPropagation ()  => this stops the the event form bubbling up to the parent elements
